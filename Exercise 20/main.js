// Question:20
// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains,
//  rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var programmingLanguages = ["Typescript", "Javascript", "Python", "PHP"];
console.log("List of Programming Languages:");
// Print array in form of list
programmingLanguages.forEach(function (language) { return console.log(language); });
