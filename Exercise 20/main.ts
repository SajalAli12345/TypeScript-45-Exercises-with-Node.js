// Question:20
// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains,
//  rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let programmingLanguages : string[] = ["Typescript","Javascript","Python","PHP"];

console.log("List of Programming Languages:");

// Print array in form of list
programmingLanguages.forEach(language => console.log(language));
