// Question : 45
// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
//  It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.
//  Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

// ANSWER*

// Define a function to create a car object with optional option.
function create_Car(manufacture, model, ...options){
   let car = {
    // Initialize a car object with manufacture and model
    manufacture: manufacture,
    model:model 
   }; 

   // Add additional option to the car object
   options.forEach(option => {
      let [key, value] = option.split(":");
      car[key.trim()] = value.trim();
   });

   return car;
}  

// call the function to create a car object
let my_car = create_Car("Toyota","Corrolla","color:Black","Sunroof:true","Year:2024");

// Print the variable
console.log(my_car);
